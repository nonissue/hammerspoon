    === HammerText ===
    Based on: https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues/1042

    WARNING: Does not work reliably / unstable. I haven't spent much time debugging it.

    How to "install":
    - Simply copy and paste this code in your "init.lua".

    How to use:
      - Add this init.lua to ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/HammerText.spoon
      - Add your hotstrings (abbreviations that get expanded) to the "keywords" list following the example format.
      
      ht = hs.loadSpoon("HammerText")
      ht.keywords ={
         nname = "Max Rydahl Andersen",
         xdate = function() return os.date("%B %d, %Y") end,
      }
      ht:start()

    Features:
    - Text expansion starts automatically in your init.lua config.
    - Hotstring expands immediately.
    - Word buffer is cleared after pressing one of the "navigational" keys.
      PS: The default keys should give a good enough workflow so I didn't bother including other keys.
          If you'd like to clear the buffer with more keys simply add them to the "navigational keys" conditional.

    Limitations:
    - Can't expand hotstring if it's immediately typed after an expansion. Meaning that typing "..name..name" will result in "My name..name".
      This is intentional since the hotstring could be a part of the expanded string and this could cause a loop.
      In that case you have to type one of the "buffer-clearing" keys that are included in the "navigational keys" conditional (which is very often the case).

Nonissue notes:
    December 27, 2019
        I think this causes memory leaks/performance problems, but I can't be sure.
        - [ ] Doesn't handle command-deleting a string (Possibly fixed December 28, 2019)
        - [ ] Doesn't handle selecting and then deleting a word

    Issues (Updated 2020-06-23)
    - [x]   Doesn't work when 'typing over' selected text
                - Oh, I think it is capturing keyboard shortcuts (Ie. When 'âŒ˜ + a' is pressed, a shouldn't be captured )
                - UPDATE: this, i think, is handled now
    - [ ]   HammerText doesn't discern between inputs, so if you start typing in one field, change focus (by say, 
            clicking on a new window, or invoke spotlight), it adds any new input to the existing 'word', even though
            the string is split across two windows
