## Other
- [ ] Cheatsheet style overlay to show all the things my config does
    - [ ] Alternate idea/addon: A chooser that lists/calls all choosers?
- [ ] Use menubar hotkey options for simple ideas?
    - [ ] Resolute could easily be written this way?
- [ ] Spoon: App context switcher (using chooser)?
    - eg. 'hammerspoon' -> opens hammerspoon console, opens vscode with hammerspoon project open
    - eg. 'scratchjs' -> opens javascript sandbox?
- [ ] update Zzz so it can do the opposte (keep computer awale for a certain amount of time)
- [x] finish inc/dec
- [ ] make all menubarlets enable/disableable through the same interface (chooser?)
- [ ] provde them with config options through chooser as well
- [ ] migrate remaining plugins to spoons
- [ ] implement better reloading? may be a spoon already for this
- [x] finish implementing Resolute
- [ ] gen proper docs for my spoons (PaywallBuster, SafariKeys, SystemContexts, Zzz)
