# TODO

- [ ] Cheatsheet style overlay to show all the things my config does
    - [ ] Alternate idea/addon: A chooser that lists/calls all choosers?
- [ ] Use menubar hotkey options for simple ideas?
    - [ ] Resolute could easily be written this way?
- [ ] Spoon: App context switcher (using chooser)?
    - eg. 'hammerspoon' -> opens hammerspoon console, opens vscode with hammerspoon project open
    - eg. 'scratchjs' -> opens javascript sandbox?
