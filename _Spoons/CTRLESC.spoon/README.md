# [WIP] CTRL-ESC.spoon

## About

_Note: This is not finished by any stretch of the imagination_

Rebinds capslock to be control when pressed with other keys (ie. `CAPSLOCK+C` is registered as `CTRL+C`) or `ESC` when `CAPSLOCK` is pressed on it's own.

## Why? There are existing solutions, why is this necessary?

There is already a [Spoon](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/ControlEscape.spoon) that provides this functionality, but there are some minor things that could be improved upon in design (IMO), and it comes bundled with some unnecessary scripts. It would be the perfect solution for someone who hasn't heard of hammerspoon before as it does try to install hammerspoon using brew/cask and also adds the required lines to your init if it can't find them. I prefer a leaner solution. I also don't think the Spoon is available on its own in the official Spoons repo. It does seem to work well in my limited usage, and it partially did inspire me to make this!
