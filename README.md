# a hammerspoon config

This is pretty unstable and changes frequently. 

* Most things are in Spoons (I plan to add better documentation)
* I haven't tested the spoons to see if they stand alone (they may use functions loaded elsewhere in my config)
* please email me at hammerspoon [ a t ] nonissue.org if you have questions/thoughts/ideas

* Out of date docs/logs can be found in the HISTORY.md file.
