# Hammerspoon .dotfiles

A very much in progress hammerspoon config. 

* Most recently I've been moving things to spoons. 
* I've created a few Spoons of my own, but the docs are lacking and they are definitely not ready for widespread use.
* please email me at hammerspoon [ a t ] nonissue.org if you have questions/thoughts/ideas

* Most of the docs are out of date, they can be found in the HISTORY.md file.
